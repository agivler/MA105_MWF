\begin{questions}
\question Circle all of the numbers below that are valid probabilities. For the numbers that are not probabilities, either convert to a probability (if possible) or explain why the number is not a probability.\\

\question Determine the probability of each of the given events.
\begin{parts}
\part Rolling two even numbers on a pair of dice.
\begin{solution}[\stretch{1}]
$\frac{3}{36}=\frac{1}{12}=0.083$
\end{solution}
\part Randomly selecting a king from a deck of playing cards.
\begin{solution}[\stretch{1}]
$\frac{13}{52}=\frac{1}{4}=0.25$
\end{solution}
\part Out of 4 puppies born, 3 are girls.
\begin{solution}[\stretch{1}]

\end{solution}
\end{parts}

\question Describe the complement of each of the following events, and find the probability of the complement.
\begin{parts}
\part Rolling two even numbers on a pair of dice.
\begin{solution}[\stretch{1}]
both dice are odd, or one die is odd and the other is even
\end{solution}
\part Randomly selecting a king from a deck of playing cards.
\begin{solution}[\stretch{1}]
randomly selecting a card and it's not a king
\end{solution}
\part Out of 3 puppies born, 2 are girls.
\begin{solution}[\stretch{1}]
out of 3 puppies, either none are girls, one is a girl, or three are girls
\end{solution}

\question Using classical probability methods, determine the probability of getting one head and one tails when two coins are flipped.
\begin{solution}[\stretch{1}]
Simple Events: HT, TH

Sample Space: \{TT, TH, HT, HH\}

P(one H, one T) = $\frac{2}{4}=0.5$
\end{solution}

\question The National Transportation and Safety Board's document M-04-04 recommends using a mean weight for adult men of 166.3 lb when calculating weight limits for boats, planes, etc. However, the sample of 40 men collected by our book's author had a mean weight of 182.9 lb. If the National Transportation and Safety Board is correct, there is a $0.00697$ probability that a random sample of 40 men would have a mean weight of 182.9 lb or higher. Do you believe the National Transportation and Safety Board's claim? Why or why not?

%\question Flip two coins 10 times and use relative frequencies to estimate the probability of getting one and and one tails. Does this exactly match your answer to the previous question?
%\begin{solution}[\stretch{1}]
%Answers will vary
%\end{solution}


%\question Out of 300 students, 156 are male and 144 are female. Is it unusual to have this many male students? Is it unlikely?
%\begin{solution}[\stretch{1}]
%It is unusual to have this many male students (because the probability of getting exactly 156 males is small), but it is not unlikely (because we would expect around 150 males)
%\end{solution}

%\question In the last month, a mechanic worked on 56 cars with exhaust leaks and 32 cars without exhaust leaks. What is the probability of randomly selecting one of these cars and getting a car without an exhaust leak?
%\begin{solution}[\stretch{1}]
%P(no exhaust leak) = $\frac{32}{56+32}=\frac{32}{88}=0.36$
%\end{solution}

%\question Why do statisticians prefer working with probabilities rather than working with odds?
%\begin{solution}[\stretch{1}]
%Probabilities are easier to do calculations with.
%\end{solution}
